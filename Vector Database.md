## A vector database is a database used for storing high-dimensional vectors such as word embeddings or image embeddings.
##### High Dimensional data (document, audio, video, image, etc) --> High Dimensional Vector --> Vector Database
##### Over 80 - 85% data out there is unstructured data, we can't easily store them into a Relational/Traditional database.
##### Set of Object (Image, Text, Audio, Video, etc) --> Embedding Model --> Objects as Vectors

## Local Vector DB: Chroma; FAISS
